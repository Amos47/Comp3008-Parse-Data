# Comp 3008 Data Parsing Project 2

This project is for parsing some data that's needed for our project.
We are consolidating event data into individual events. The output data will be analyzed in R.

## Notice

This is not traditional open source. You will not be persecuted for using it, but you will not be supported.

Passing this off as your own work is expressly forbidden.

## Install

1. clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:Amos47/Comp3008-Parse-Data.git`
2. cd into the directory `cd Comp3008-Parse-Data`
3. `npm install`

## Usage

Run with arguments for input and output.

`node parser.js {input_file} {output_file}`

## R summary stats

To run the summary stats open r studio, or whatever you use for r and source the `summaryStats.R` file.

Be sure to run it in this folder or the data will be missing.

You may also have to set the working directory with the `setwd` command.
